I want you to introduce the structure command 
I dont want you to write any implementation 
I just want you to create the entry point of the command, where:

1. the config object has been populated and its ready to be used. 
2. a file iterator based on the config file has been already created and we have a list of files for processing 
3. a place holder exist to connect the actual structure code
   
I will bring the actual implementation of the structure code from another project
